# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. React Hydration Error

**Problem**: React hydration mismatch in layout.tsx due to SSR/client-side differences
**Solution**:

- Created `client-components.tsx` wrapper for client-only components
- Used proper dynamic imports with `ssr: false` in client component
- Fixed NotificationPrompt and AudioEnabler components to prevent hydration mismatches

### 2. Camera Deletion Issues

**Problem**: Camera deletion from cards not working properly, showing demo images after refresh
**Solution**:

- Added new DELETE endpoint `/api/cameras/<cam_id>` in Flask backend
- Added `deleteCamera()` API function in frontend
- Updated camera card delete handler to use proper deletion endpoint
- Ensures camera is stopped and removed from database properly

### 3. Audio/Ring Sound Issues

**Problem**: No ringing sounds when person is detected
**Solution**:

- Enhanced `alert-sound.ts` with async methods
- Added audio context resume logic for browser autoplay policies
- Created `AudioEnabler` component to prompt user for audio permission
- Updated AlertContext to use async sound methods

### 4. Flask Server Import Issues

**Problem**: Module import errors preventing Flask server from starting
**Solution**:

- Fixed imports in `app.py` with proper fallback logic
- Added try-catch blocks for `mizva.storage` and `mizva.db` imports
- Ensured compatibility with different Python path configurations

### 5. Live Stream Update Issues

**Problem**: Camera streams not updating after adding new cameras without page refresh
**Solution**:

- Enhanced camera initialization logic in `CameraCard` component
- Added proper event source management and cleanup
- Improved state synchronization between frontend and backend

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Camera Management

- Proper camera deletion API endpoint
- Improved cleanup functionality

### 2. Audio Alert System

- Web Audio API integration with browser compatibility
- User interaction-based audio enablement

## Testing Instructions

1. **Camera Deletion**:

   - Add a camera in live monitoring
   - Delete it using the card delete button
   - Refresh page - should not show demo images

2. **Audio Alerts**:

   - Enable audio when prompted
   - Trigger a face detection event
   - Should hear ringing sounds for matches

3. **Real-time Updates**:

   - Add a new camera
   - Stream should appear immediately without page refresh
   - Events should update in real-time

4. **Logs and Alerts**:
   - Check alerts page for new detections
   - Verify detection logs are updating
   - Confirm bell notification shows new alerts

## Environment Setup

1. **Frontend**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3001)
2. **Backend**: `.\mizva\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flask --app mizva.app run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001`

Both servers are now running successfully with all fixes applied.
